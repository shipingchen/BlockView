# BlockView
This is an open source for blockchain visulisation.

### Block Eye Blockchain Visualisation Project
Two strategies to use the code:
```
For frontend-solo way, you could directly use the "blockchain_solo".
This would be a quicker way for visualisation.
The specific instructions of its use please see the README.md in its directory.
```
```
For an integration way, you could directly use the "blockchain_front_end".
This would be an integrated way which requires backend for visualisation.
The specific instructions of its use please see the README.md in its directory.
```
